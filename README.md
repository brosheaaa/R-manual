# R-manual
I took notes while completing DataCamp's Introduction to R, Importing Data in R (Part 1), and Intermediate R, and then organized them into this manual. These lessons were my first exposure to R so there may be incorrect information. The examples used were either the example used in the DataCamp lesson, or created by myself. I gathered all of this information from the DataCamp learning modules.
